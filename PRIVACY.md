## What is collected?
Nothing at all. Everything stays offline, and no Internet connection is ever used or needed.

## What is stored?
The following elements are stored **locally** on the current device:
- Last used algorithm.
- Last used options for generation: password length, iterations, character sets, and counter.
- Whether the password should be shown in clear text or hidden.

Other informations that you input, such as master passwords, websites and usernames are **not**
stored, and only exist in memory until the application is closed.
